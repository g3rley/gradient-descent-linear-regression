# Optimization Using Gradient Descent: Linear Regression

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses. The project investigates three different approaches to this problem: NumPy and Scikit-Learn linear regression models, as well as the construction and optimization of the sum of squares cost function with gradient descent from scratch.

## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install these packages using pip:

```bash 
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install jupyter
```

## Usage
To run this project, simply clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser. From there, you can run each cell of the notebook to see the results of each approach to the linear regression problem.

## Credits
This project is based on the course materials from deeplearning.ai. The code has been adapted and modified for this repository.
